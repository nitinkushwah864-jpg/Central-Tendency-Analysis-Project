# 🍷 White Wine Quality: Central Tendency Analysis

### 🎯 Project Overview
In this project, I performed an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the White Wine Quality dataset. The goal was to identify the "representative values" for key chemical properties of wine using statistical measures of central tendency: **Mean, Median, and Mode**.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:** * `Pandas` (Data manipulation)
    * `NumPy` (Numerical calculations)
    * `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (Data visualization)

### 📊 Key Findings & Results
After analyzing 4,898 samples of white wine, I calculated the following representative values for the dataset:

| Feature | Representative Value (Mean/Mode) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fixed Acidity** | 6.85 g/dm³ |
| **Volatile Acidity** | 0.28 g/dm³ |
| **Citric Acid** | 0.33 g/dm³ |
| **Overall Quality Score** | 6 (Most Frequent) |

**Observations:**
* **Distributions:** Most features follow a normal distribution, though some (like Volatile Acidity) show a slight positive skew 📈.
* **Quality:** The majority of wines in this dataset are rated a '6', followed by '5' and '7'. 
* **Methodology:** Since the mean and median were very close for most acidity features, the **Mean** was selected as the most reliable measure for the group's central tendency.

### 🚀 How to Use
1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/central_Tendency_proj.git`
2. **Install requirements:** `pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib`
3. **Run the notebook:** Open `central_Tendency_proj.ipynb` to see the full step-by-step analysis.
